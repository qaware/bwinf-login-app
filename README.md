# Setup

1. Install NodeJS LTS https://nodejs.org/en/download.
2. Install VSCode https://code.visualstudio.com/.
3. Install Git https://git-scm.com/.
4. Clone the Github repository https://github.com/qaware/bwinf-login-app.git by executing `git clone https://github.com/qaware/bwinf-login-app.git` in a folder of your choosing.
5. Open the cloned repository folder in VScode File -> Open Folder... and select the bwinf-login-app folder.
6. Install the recommended Extensions for this Project by selecting the Extensions Tab on the left and typing `@recommended` in the search bar. Then press the *Install Workspace Recommended Extensions*, which is a cloud with an arrow pointing down beneath the search bar.
7. In the bottom of your VScode window you can find a terminal. If there is no terminal open it by pressing Terminal -> New Terminal or strg-shift-รถ. Enter `npm install` and execute the command.
8. Install [localtunnel](https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel) by entering `npm install -g localtunnel` into the terminal.

# Collaboration

This project will be worked on by teams of three to five people. You can enhance your collaboration effort by following these steps:

1. You can quickly work on the same code base with your collegues by using the [Live Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare) plugin. For this to work you need a Microsoft or Github Account. Then simply follow the [Live Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare) Quickstart guide.
2. If you want to quickly expose the app to your colleagues open a new terminal (keep the npm run dev process running in the other terminal) and enter `lt --port 5173`. This will generate a URL which is publicly available. You can find the password under https://loca.lt/mytunnelpassword. This should be done by the Live Share Host so the other people can also see the app on their browser.
